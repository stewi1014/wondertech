# WonderTech

A modpack that combines Big Globe world generation with some classic tech, and some other stuff.
WonderTech is somewhat inspired by FTB Infinity Evolved, but also includes new terrain generation.

The terrain generation is a big one here. Big Globe is used, with extensions to support terrain generation features from the other mods (Over 100 structures added).

A number of tech mods and some magic mods are included as well. It is a kitchen sink pack; there are no quests or clear progression path, but rather an array of content to explore and discover alongside the incredible new world.

----

This modpack represents a few casual hours of toying around now and then; these mods represent years of effort.
If you like the modpack, go say thanks to some of the developers who wrote the mods.
