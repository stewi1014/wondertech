# WonderTech
A modpack that combines Big Globe world generation with a number of dimension, tech and magic mods.

WonderTech expands on BigGlobe with a variety of tech, magic and exploration mods. 
A number of datapacks extending support for these mods to Big Globe have been developed,
giving a whole bunch more content to be found in the world.

Vast cave systems and over 20 new ores from *GragTech CEu Modern*, *Mekanism*, *Immersive Engineering* and more can be found underground, while *Ars Nouveau*, *Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks*, *Dungeons and Taverns* and *YUNG's Structures* add structures that can be found throughout the world. 3 new worlds have also been added, with *Eternal Starlight*, *The Undergarden* and *Deeper and Darker* adding new dimensions to explore and a huge number more mods add items, mobs, blocks, tools and more.

## Notes
- This pack is quite intensive. I would reccomend 16GB of ram and at least 8 strong cores.
- Press _R_ to reload the shader - this might be needed when resizing the window.

## Install Server

#### Using mrpack-install
To install the server, install [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install) and run `mrpack-install wondertech`

`mrpack-install update wondertech` doesn't currently work. But running `mrpack-install wondertech` again should work. Make sure you have a backup though.
